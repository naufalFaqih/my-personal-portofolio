# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio project! This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a powerful React framework for building fast and user-friendly web applications. This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and services as a Machine Learning Engineer based in Indonesia.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio.git
   cd my-portfolio
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   # or
   yarn dev
   # or

   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
